<h1>DogBreed Detection using Transfer Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch</h1>
This project implements a dog breed detection system using transfer learning techniques with TensorFlow and PyTorch. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (ILSVRC-2012-CLS) and fine-tuned on the Stanford Dogs dataset to classify dog breeds.

Dog breed detection is a challenging computer vision task that involves identifying the breed of a dog from an input image. This project utilizes transfer learning, a technique that leverages pre-trained models, to build an accurate dog breed detection system. The model architecture used is MobileNet V2, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network well-suited for mobile and embedded vision applications.
